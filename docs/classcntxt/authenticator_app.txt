File: authenticator_app.php

Purpose
- Legacy/lightweight authenticator that loads company/user context using a fixed DB.

Primary flow
- Reads cookies and request params; sets defaults and time helpers.
- Uses ip_visitor_country() (HTTP geoplugin.net) for geo info.
- Connects directly to saas_maeynuor_gmail_com using saas credentials.
- If userid cookie exists:
  - Loads companysetting id=1 and assigns many globals.
  - Loads user data from uerp_user and related department/designation/team lead.
  - Loads theme_customizer (user or default).
- Sets title/description defaults if missing.

Inputs
- Cookies: userid, track, sortset.
- Request: id, smsbd, bfacklink, kroyee, sheba, pointer.

Outputs
- Global variables used in templates (company, user, theme, currency, etc.).

Data/DB
- DB: saas_maeynuor_gmail_com.
- Tables: companysetting, uerp_user, departments, designation, theme_customizer.

Side effects
- None, aside from DB reads.

Risks / Notes
- Hardcoded DB name and credentials.
- Error reporting is partially enabled and changed multiple times.
- Geo lookup uses HTTP.
