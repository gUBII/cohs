File: ai_wizard.php

Purpose
- AI-assisted workflow: upload PDF, OCR extract fields, create client/project/roster/invoice/task records, and show animated status.

Primary flow
- Includes authenticator.php and head.php.
- Defines OCR.Space API helper for PDF and text parsing utilities.
- On POST with fileUpload:
  - Saves PDF to uploads/ and calls OCR.Space API.
  - Extracts fields, then inserts into ai_wizard table.
- Loads latest ai_wizard record and uses it to create a client and project:
  - Creates a CLIENT user if not found.
  - Creates project, shifting schedule, team allocations, service agreement, roster allocation, invoice, and task.
- Renders a video + animated status messages.

Inputs
- POST: fileUpload (PDF file).

Outputs
- HTML page with animated messages.

Data/DB
- Tables: ai_wizard, uerp_user, project, shifting_schedule, project_team_allocation, service_agreement_addon, shifting_allocation, ndis_invoices, tasks.

Side effects
- Writes many records across project/roster/invoice/task tables.

Risks / Notes
- Hardcoded OCR API key.
- Uses hardcoded placeholders for some parsed values (clientname, description, etc.).
- Contains likely bug in post-insert user lookup ($found set from $rs2 instead of $rs22).
