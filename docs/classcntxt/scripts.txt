File: scripts.php

Purpose
- Global JS loader and client-side utility functions; also defines notification modal HTML.

Primary flow
- Injects hidden iframe pointing to x.php (likely for background tasks).
- Renders notification modal with bulk actions.
- Loads vendor JS: jQuery 3.7.1, Bootstrap, OverlayScrollbars, DataTables, Chart.js, Select2, Intro.js, Plyr, Glide, etc.
- Loads app JS: js/base/*, js/plugins/*, js/pages/*.
- Conditionally loads jQuery UI + inspinia.js for task_manager.php and appointment_manager.php.
- Defines printPDF and printPDF2 (html2canvas + jsPDF) for chart sections.
- Defines many AJAX helpers for loading modules and processor endpoints.
- Enables drag/drop sorting for solution/module lists and posts to sorting_processor_*.
- Defines table sorting and search helpers.

Inputs
- Query string: url (for conditional asset loads).
- DOM IDs used by printPDF and sorting helpers.

Outputs
- JS and modal HTML included on most pages.

Data/DB
- Indirectly triggers processor endpoints: sorting_processor_solutions.php, sorting_processor_modules.php.

Side effects
- Loads x.php in an iframe on every page that includes scripts.php.
- AJAX calls to modules and processors; impacts DB when sort order changes.

Risks / Notes
- Heavy asset load; duplicates possible if other pages include their own jQuery.
- Some helper functions build URLs by concatenation without validation.
