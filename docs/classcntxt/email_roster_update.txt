File: email_roster_update.php

Purpose
- Sends shift update email with timing and address details.

Primary flow
- On POST processor=shiftallocation:
  - Reads semail and employeename.
  - Attempts to read clientname/stime/etime/address/note using $_POST["$clientname"] etc (likely bug).
  - Sends SMTP email via mail.goodwillcare.net.

Inputs
- POST: processor=shiftallocation, semail, employeename, clientname, stime, etime, address1, note1 (intended).

Outputs
- Email sent message or error.

Data/DB
- None.

Side effects
- Sends outbound email.

Risks / Notes
- Hardcoded SMTP credentials.
- Variable-variable POST access likely breaks data fields.
