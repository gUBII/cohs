File: email_roster_suspend.php

Purpose
- Sends a shift suspension email to a staff member.

Primary flow
- On POST processor=shiftallocation:
  - Reads semail and employeename from POST.
  - Attempts to read clientname but uses $_POST["$clientname"] (likely bug).
  - Sends email via mail.nexis365.com SMTP.

Inputs
- POST: processor=shiftallocation, semail, employeename, clientname (intended).

Outputs
- Email sent message or error.

Data/DB
- None.

Side effects
- Sends outbound email.

Risks / Notes
- Hardcoded SMTP credentials.
- Variable-variable POST access likely returns empty client name.
