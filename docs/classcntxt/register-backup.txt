- Stage 1 (no useridx cookie): collects email and posts to security.php.
- Stage 2 (useridx cookie exists): multi-step wizard collecting personal/business info, solution selection, and referral source.
- Posts data to cookie.php at each step.
- Final step posts to cookie.php to complete and auto-login.

Inputs
- Cookies: useridx and wizard fields.
- POST: remail/rotp (stage 1) via security.php; subsequent data via cookie.php.

Outputs
- HTML wizard UI.

Data/DB
